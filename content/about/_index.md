#### Hi! I am Langxuan He, you can call me **Harry**.
Iâ€™m an independent Game Developer and also a Game Designer. Currently, I'm at Carnegie Mellon University -Entertainment Technology Center to pursue further studies. My future career dream is to become a successful Level Designer and become both artistic and technical. This website is my portfolio website, which shows some interesting work during my path in Game Design. Please feel free to take a look and welcome to my creative space!

I am a very team player. Rather than wrestling with a great idea myself, I prefer to discuss a combined idea with a team. And I think a single mind is limited, and diverse minds are what makes great games. Other than that, my motto is "Life is a hardcore game".You only live once, why not try something cool?

#### Education

* **Carnegie Mellon University -Entertainment Technology Center** 
M.E.T Entertainment Technology.
* **Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist University United International College** 
B.A Computer Science and Technology.
