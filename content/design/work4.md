I mainly responsible for designing this level .In this level , two players are divided into two sub-areas, but they need to cooperate with each other to overcome the dungeon traps.The core idea of this level is "Help each other". Although two players are divided phsically in the level, they can help each other by looking around his(her) sub area and find a way. Here is the game flow of this level:

1. Player Red 🔴 /Player Yellow 🟡 press orange buttons open their door infront （Enter Section 1)

2. Player Yellow 🟡 Touches missile to break the fragile wall

3. Player Yellow 🟡 help Player Red 🔴 by pressing green button(which will generate missile on Player Yellow 🟡 side) and distroy the nail walls

4. Player Yellow 🟡 get through the nail wall area and press the green button in front to help Player Red 🔴 break the fragile wall , then Player Red 🔴 Press orange button in front to help Player Yellow 🟡 open the door(Enter Section 2)

5. Player Red 🔴 and Player Yellow 🟡 get close to the wall and gnerate the shield to go through the nail-shooting area and press the button to lift up the nail-shooting wall
   
6. Reach the Exit
