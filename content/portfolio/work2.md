Procedural generated map. the number of rooms in each sub-level is certain, but the selection and arrangement of room types are randomly distributed. I use scriptable to store the room require- ments of each sub-level. The generation process uses scriptable to traverse each sub-level one by one to ensure that the sub-levels are generated in order. For the problem of room overlap caused by randomness, I use the method of backtracking opera- tion to solve it
#### Item

The random generation of items adopts the method of arranging generation points. The items required by each sub level will be randomly generated at the generation points. The items required by each sub level and the corresponding number of items are also stored through scriptable. After the room is generated, the objects are randomly generated.
