## Game Design

In this game , me and my another Designer : Yichen are thinking of using the idea of Emergent Design Patternt in our puzzle game experience. We thought the Emergent Design patern can make the game have depth with simple interactions. The player will be more likely have a experience of : using tools to solve the problem, not providing an question and wait for the player to fill the blank.
